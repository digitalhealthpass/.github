# Open Digital Health Pass

In 2022, IBM Watson Health became Merative, a new healthcare company committed to building a more connected future in health. Building on Watson Health’s nearly 50 years of healthcare innovation, Merative is pioneering the use of cloud, real-world data, and industry-leading AI. Merative, a company committed to supporting the open-source community as demonstrated by its contributions to Linux for Health, has decided to release the Watson Health credentialing technology (previously IBM Digital Health Pass) into open-source, under the GitHub “Digital Health Pass” project, making a sophisticated set of credentialing capabilities broadly available to healthcare solutions across the globe.
